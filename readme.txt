== Description ==

This plugin creates a new Genesis settings page that allows you to design the Genesis theme. Has settings for various colors, font stacks, sizes, borders, and more. The plugin writes a CSS file (that can be cache'd) and loads.

NOTE: This plugin requires the Genesis Framework to function and will NOT work on other themes / frameworks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does it do? =

Allows you to add some customization to the Genesis framework without editing CSS files.

= The plugin won't activate =

You must have Genesis or a Genesis child theme installed and activated on your site.

= This looks weird on my child theme =

While this was built for the base Genesis framework, it should also be useful for child themes. Keep in mind, however, that some child themes have different customizations that deviate from the base framework so it may not be a perfect match.

= There is an option missing! =

By all means, let me know! I've done my best to include everything, but if I've missed something [please let me know in the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/genesis-palette/ "Genesis Palette Support Forum")
